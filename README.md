To install
==========

1. Unpack the zip file into a directory
2. In the location bar type chrome://extensions
3. Check the Developer Mode box
4. Click Load unpacked extension
5. Select the directory where you unpacked the zip file

Optional
--------
Assign shortcut keys:

1. Go to chrome://extensions
2. Click on "Keyboard shortcuts" at the bottom of the page
3. Assign shortcuts to each of the Wegotools commands. I use:
  * cmd-shift-s for staging
  * cmd-shift-p for production
  * cmd-shift-l for localhost

Usage
===============
1. When you're on a URL for staging, wegowise.com, or localhost an icon will show up in the location bar at the right.  Red for production, blue for staging, green for localhost.
2. Right clicking on the page will show a "Wegotools" menu from which you can
  * choose whether to open the domain in a new tab or the current tab
  * select the domain for the (current or new) tab
3. If you assign shortcut keys you can use those just like using the menus
